							<h4>Jan 2016 - Present</h4>
							<h3>Millgate Computers Junior Software Developer</h3>
							<p>My current role at Millgate Computer systems, one half of a two person development team.<br>
							This role has been extremely varied thus far, including work with an expansive database driven company intranet, Python based web crawlers, web development and website management for both internal and external clients and App development.<br>
							Most of my current knowledge has been gained at Millgate, working under a very knowledgeable senior developer and working mostly independently has allowed me to really develop my skills in a hands on working environment, and working on so many different projects and with so many different languages has taught me to be flexible and quick to learn.</p>
							<br>
							<h4>Late 2014 - Jan 2016</h4>
							<h3>Capita - Customer Experience advisor</h3>
							<p>My role prior to Millgate was at Capita, as a customer experience advisor. A great deal of my own time while at capita was spent self teaching the basics of website development, becoming competent in HTML, CSS and Javascript, and learning the basics of PHP. Upon begining to search for a development role I furthered my knowledge and began to truly understand the basics of writing code, allowing me to quickly pick up new and interesting languages, while my role at capita helped build my soft skills, such as self management and communication. While Capita was not truly part of the career path I intended to follow it did help me achieve my goals</p>

						<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="languages">
							<h3>PHP</h3>
							<p>PHP, alongside SQL, has been my most extensively used language, and has become a language I am both very comfortable writing, and find very enjoyable to write. I am experienced with writing both PHP to run on a webserver as well as on the command line where necessary</p>
							<br>
							<h3>SQL</h3>
							<p>I have used SQL throughout my job at Millgate, and am experienced with everything from basic queries, through to views, virtual tables, and recursive CTE and </p>
							<br>
							<h3>JavaScript</h3>
							<p>The main project at Millgate has been the creation of an internal portal, designed to replace the gui of many different tools used by staff. This project has heavily utilised JavaScript to make pages functional and interactive in real time, and to manage the rendering of the site itself through ajax</p>
							<br>
							<h3>HTML + CSS</h3>
							<p>I am experienced with both website creation and management, having managed the Millgate website and created a number of websites from scratch, this one for example</p>
							<br>
							<h3>Python</h3>
							<p>My main use of python was for a group of webcrawlers at Millgate, designed to retrieve and manipulate data for customers. This was to take pressure away from and free up the time of the administration staff that originally carried out the task manually. Though this has been my main use of Python, I have used it for a number of other smaller tasks and have a reasonable knowledge of the language</p>
